#K-Means clustering implementation


#You will also have to import relevant libraries for graph plotting and maths functions.

# ====
# Define a function that reads data in from the csv files  
# HINT: http://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html. 
# HINT2: Remember that CSV files are comma separated, so you should use a "," as a delimiter. 
# HINT3: Ensure you are reading the csv file in the correct mode.
#visualise the result of our K-Means algorithm applied to the data

task in hand. will be clustering countries given in the exel basing on the birth rate and life expectancy

>The number of countries belonging to each cluster
> The list of countries belonging to each cluster
> The mean Life Expectancy and Birth Rate for each cluster
